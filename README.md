__Holiday Chalange Solvro ML 2024__
(original title: Wakacyjne Wyzwanie Solvro ML 2024)

## Description:

The recruitment task for the machine learning section of the scientific club consists of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset and conducting clustering.

The dataset must be properly cleaned and prepared before analysis. The results were then presented visually. A quantitative evaluation was also conducted using appropriate metrics

The clustering results can also be viewed interactively using visualizations created with the Streamlit library

### Task steps:

1) EDA
2) Preprocessing
3) Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the results
4) Presentation of results

### Technology:

The task is performed using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, umap, and streamlit.

### Algoritms:

1) K-Means
2) UMAP
3) DBSCAN

### Evaluation metrics:

1) Silhouette Coefficient
2) Davies-Bouldin score

### Dataset Description:

The dataset TheCocktailDB consists of a list of cocktails and the ingredients needed to make them.

## How To Run Visualization in Streamlit:

1) Clone the repository
2) Install the required dependencies
3) Run the Streamlit app using the following command: streamlit run results_visualization.py
4) Open the app in your browser
